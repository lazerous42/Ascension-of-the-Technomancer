# Disabling a skill prevents players from learning or using that skill, but does not change the player's known skills.
# Skill items previously generated as loot may be found but not used, and subsequent loot will not generate with that skill.
# Skill orbs may still drop from mobs / players unless disabled separately, but may not be used.
# This setting is save-game safe: it may be disabled and re-enabled without affecting the saved game state.
