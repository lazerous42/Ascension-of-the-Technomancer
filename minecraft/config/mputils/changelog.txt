§bConfig ~ Turned on connected inner edge of chisel CTM textures
§bConfig ~ Allow chiseling back to vanilla leaves
§cBugfix ~ Renamed all CoFH oregen files.  A previous revision added a -Ores suffix to all files.  This caused CoFH to recreate a default vanilla ore file (with retrogen on!).  This is obviously bad, so the suffix was dropped from all files

§bConfig ~ ExtraCells is now thoroughly Greggy
§bConfig ~ Dimensional shard ore will spawn on AR control worlds (but not vacuum worlds or Feyweald)

§1§l§nVersion 5.0.1§r§1§l (Boldly going where no update has gone before)
§cBugfix ~  ~ Fixed using compressor to make unstable ingot blocks out of mobius ingots.  You can also used the unstable ones in a crafting table again.
§cBugfix ~  ~ Turn off colored beacon beams.  They break the psudo-inversion sigil ritual

§bConfig ~ Setting some initial orbital theta values for each planet
§bConfig ~ Disable hardcore darkness in AR space dimension (kind of doesn't make sense)
§bConfig ~ Asteroid distance tweaks
§bConfig ~ More oredict consolidation of aluminum/aluminium and aluminium accessories.  This consolidation was moved to the initial scripts file, as it's more generic than commands that apply to just AR
§bConfig ~ AR laser drill ore list was changed to a blacklist and emptied out, as all ores that spawn on a planet are eligible for laser drilling (because it's actually grabbing blocks from the planet surface)
§bConfig ~ Lots more ores available in geodes
§bConfig ~ Exposure to vacuum made extra deadly... for extra fun
§aAdded ~ Added redstone/electrotine asteroid and tinkered with probabilities/variability of asteroids

§bConfig ~ Removed AE2 custom inscriber recipes from script logic due to CraftTweaker being incompatible with AE2v3
§bConfig ~ Changed to Railcraft and Immersive Engineering coke ovens to give the unique uses as opposed to the IE version being demonstrably better. IE's coke over is faster at 1200 ticks per operation where as Railcraft's produces twice as much creosote (500mb instead of 250mb)
§aAdded ~ Added GT Vein Locator
§bConfig ~ Setting more Advanced Rocketry recipes

§aAdded ~ Added Fossils and Archeology Revival 
§bConfig ~ Mod version updates
§bConfig ~ Knapsack recipe now enabled
§bConfig ~ Re-introducing smeltery as a later game ore multiplier.  3x returns, but requires trip to the moon and pyrothium for fuel.  Guide notes have been updated accordingly.

§1§l§nVersion 4.3.9§r§1§l
§cBugfix ~  ~ Fixed unification exploit with the AnyIron and AnyCopper oredict entries and JABBA barrels.  Also deactivated AnyCopper and AnyIron in AOBD and Technomancy pure ores

§1§l§nVersion 4.3.8§r§1§l
§cBugfix ~  ~ Disabled Baublelicious magic items because they have easy recipes.  This mod should still allow for Botania and Thaumcraft baubles to be consolidated using the entangling items.  If it doesn't then this mod will be pulled from the load out in a future release

§1§l§nVersion 4.3.7§r§1§l
§bConfig ~ Fixed GlobalProperties.cfg from JAS restore after update
§bConfig ~ Added a special thanks section for users who have helped with bug tracking to the introduction page of the FTBUtils guide
§cBugfix ~ Disable Railcraft residual heat block to prevent associated bugs (what the hell does this block even do anyway?), it is known to cause incompatibilities with Chromaticraft pylon reconstruction.

§1§l§nVersion 4.3.5§r§1§l
§bConfig ~ Sort out changes to spawn tables after deactivating BoP biome overrides
§bConfig ~ Updated ThaumicExploration
§cBugfix ~ Back dates ThaumicNEI to prevent last TC recipe accessed from "sticking" in the NEI recipes array in memory and appearing inappropriately in subsequent lookups

§1§l§nVersion 4.2.4§r§1§l

§bConfig ~ ore berry bushes are 25% rarer
§bConfig ~ turned off unnecessary mod types in AOBD configs
§cBugfix ~ changed material properties for mithril from 67 to 203 to enable more ore products

§1§l§nVersion 4.2.3§r§1§l
§cBugfix ~ turn off BoP vanilla biome overrides to prevent issues with Chromaticraft plant spawning (specifically void reeds)
§bConfig ~ Taint too common now (although ethereal blooms are basically free), dropped from 25 to 15.  Wake up and smell the TAINT

§1§l§nVersion 4.2.2§r§1§l
§cBugfix ~ Deactivated ore conversions in JWIN, GT5u is already doing this, a competing mod doing this is disruptive to controlled
§cBugfix ~ GT5u settings are the cause of passive mobs harming each other.  3 in a single block causes them to damage each other.  This has been increased to 5
§cBugfix ~ Passive WATERCREATURE type enemies have had their spawn cap lowered 10->5 (Minecraft default with normal spawning), and spawn tick rate increased 10->100.  Chunk spawning now enabled at the default rate of 0.1.
§bConfig ~ MoC sharks moved to WATERMONSTER spawn list

§1§l§nVersion 4.2.1§r§1§l

§1§l§nVersion 4.2.0§r§1§l (Thermonuclear Shaft Update)
§bConfig ~ Increased taint biome frequency again, still too rare
§bConfig ~ One last fragment weight tweak.  Fragments are a moderately common drop now
§bConfig ~ Guide tweaks
§bConfig ~ Stupid fragments, stupid loot table, just spawn when and were I tell you to.
§bConfig ~ More weight for fragments!!! Custom weights and spawn counts don't seem to have an effect.  However, multiple instances of fragments can be added to the loot table to simulate higher weights.  Each instance added to the loot table will take the standard properties of a CC fragment record in that loot table (weight, min, and max)
§bConfig ~ Another boost to ChromatiCraft fragment spawn weight
§bConfig ~ Allow admins to open all guardian chests
§bConfig ~ Coal coke now requires a compressor to turn into blocks
§bConfig ~ Imm. Eng lightning rod now as a slightly easier recipe that Infinity Evolved
§cBugfix ~ Used zzzzzcustomconfigs to fix Pam's HarvestCraft sesame seeds not dropping when grown on Agricraft crops.  It does this by adding the appropriate oredict entries during client/server init (onWorldLoad isn't early enough in the process)
§aAdded ~ Added zzzzzcustomconfigs
§bConfig ~ During some non-Agricraft testing, it was observed that using a watering can is more than 2x as effective at inducing growth ticks in Agricraft crops.  The growth tick multiplier was adjusted 1.0 -> 0.6
§bConfig ~ Weeds will destroy crop sticks when the player doesn't use a rake.
§bConfig ~ Mobius ingots are now a part of high tier HP upgrade canisters

§bConfig ~ Disable Rutile ore berries
§bConfig ~ Removing ElecriCraft for balance reasons (Seriously, a 60 Trillion RF capacity battery?!)
§bConfig ~ RotaryCraft config tweaks
§bConfig ~ Removed ReactorCraft-Ores.json file, it has literally no effect (sorry, no retrogen.  The built in one hangs on world load)
§bConfig ~ Another slight boost in info fragment weights (there are like ~250 to find, they need to be a common chest drop)
§bConfig ~ Added a CoFH file for TiCon cobalt to retrogen it
§bConfig ~ Lava is not allowed as a fuel for the smeltery.  This is a preventative action as the smeltery is still disabled at this time, but it will probably be allowed in a future update
§bConfig ~ Advent of Ascension updated to 2.5
§bConfig ~ Updated CustomNPCs and OpenSecurity
§bConfig ~ Removed Hearts mod and loot table entries.  Replaced with TiCon Heart Canisters
§bConfig ~ Advanced drawbridges are created in GT assembler, I literally can't make a vanilla crafting recipe for them.  MineTweaker just throws errors
§cBugfix ~ Using Thaumic NEI to address issues with custom infusion recipes not appearing in NEI because you never actually "unlock" them
§aAdded ~ Added Thaumic NEI
§bConfig ~ Added custom recipes for the Tinkers Construct HP upgrades

§1§l§nVersion 3.13.9§r§1§l
§bConfig ~ Deactivated Et Futurum doors to eliminate iron dupe using the 6 iron plates -> 3 iron doors recipe.  Malisis Doors already creates the 1.8+ doors

§1§l§nVersion 3.13.8§r§1§l
§bConfig ~ Fixed the TE energy cell recipes that we're broken in a previous update ("cheaper" looking duplicate recipes involved frames, not cells)

§1§l§nVersion 3.13.7§r§1§l
§bConfig ~ Increase in electrotine ore deposits (solar panels can be very expensive)

§1§l§nVersion 3.13.6§r§1§l
§bConfig ~ Switched GT "magic metals" vein to generate less silver and more gold
§bConfig ~ Given "magic metals" vein a smaller size, these produced a massive vein in test worlds.  Mithril is also available in small clumps in overworld and nether

§cBugfix ~ Fixed the TE electrical steel recipes requiring steel plates and not the item
§cBugfix ~ Fixed TE pulverizer creating silicon plates and not the item

§1§l§nVersion 3.13.4§r§1§l

§bConfig ~ Switched Nuclear Control to use GregTech recipes
§bConfig ~ Client directory cleanup/maintenance
