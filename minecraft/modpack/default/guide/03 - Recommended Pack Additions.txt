This pack is intended to be used with Mo' Creatures but cannot redistribute it.  It is highly recommended that you install this mod as documented in the pack description.  Config files and spawning tables are provided as a part the pack installation (however, they will cause no harm if you choose not to use it).  Once installed, you will then need to navigate to your ../minecraft/scripts directory and rename Mo' Creatures.save to Mo' Creatures.zs and restart the game for the changes to take effect (yes, I know about "/mt reload" just trust me and restart the client).

Be aware that when you pull updates through the FTB client, you will need to add the recommended addons (Mo' Creatures and Chococraft) back into your installation and reactivate the Mo' Creatures script again as described above.

One final thing to be aware of.  If you have an load up a world without Mo' Creatures installed, and then add the mod in, there will be some minor disruption of the included Just Another Spawner (JAS) configuration files.  Specifically, you will get additional spawn table records of all entities from Mo' Creatures added to all biomes spawn tables.  This is an artifact of how JAS creates it's default configuration files.  To compensate for this, I have included an additional copy the packs original spawn tables in ../minecraft/config/JustAnotherSpawnerRestore.  To perform the restoration, delete ../minecraft/config/JustAnotherSpawner and copy ../minecraft/config/JustAnotherSpawnerRestore back to ../minecraft/config/JustAnotherSpawner to replace the folders and files you deleted.  Always copy the restore folder to the original name, don't just perform a rename as you will loose the backup spawn tables I provided.
